        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>{{ project.short-description }}</p>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Shortly after enrolling in Bloc.io, a coding bootcamp, I was assigned to build a Spotify-like project from the scratch to understand best practices in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <h2> Challenge</h2>
        <p> Of course there were many challenges,some of them were actually writing the code in correct order and syntax,another more complicated like switching between songs,updating player bar while song playing and many more. The goal of BlocJams was to learn as much as I could about Frontend development by implementing my knowledge directly into the project. In order to create this music player I had to get comfortable with concepts I hadn't worked with before:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Git & GitHub</li>
          <li>JavaScript,DOM Scripting,Buzz,JQuery</li>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>After going through my code,I realized many of my errors were syntax and reference related. For other problems I had to do a lot of research,go through many forums asking more advanced developers or who faced the same problem for advice,as well as spending hours on comming up with new ways to solve and debug the issue. </p>
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>As a result of completing BlocJams,I have learned how to solve the problems,write clean understandable code and test each future before moving to the next one. While creating this project I used Atom and had constantly had a live preview window open to check if my code worked as well as Chrome console.</p>
        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Bloc curriculum provides detailed guidance to focus on every single future as well as great mentor support who directs me to the right path and explaines where I should be focusing my energy. While building BlocJams I have learned a lot about Frontend Development,I became proficient in Git & GitHub and more comfortable with JavaScript,DOM Scripting and JQuery. Plus it was awesome experience of making my own music player. Check it out any device! -<a href = "http://bitbox.netlify.com/"> BlocJams</a> </p>
