title: The Challenge
---


Even though the Bloc curriculum is well explained and structured for easy understanding, I faced many challenges during my web development program. It is not easy, not even close. Since the program is short you have to REALLY dedicate yourself, I received great support from Bloc, but after all it's up to you to succeed. I had countless errors with small details, major problems like JavaScript syntax,functions, arrays, objects and implementing it all together is even more difficult. As well as the wording of the tasks was also a big issue since English is my second language. But none of this is compare to the self-motivation, self-control, and time management I had to put into the program. So yes the program is short and might seem like it's not legitimate enough to start a career from compared to a traditional 4 year degree. But the short length is actually an advantage as in you spend your time learning strictly about coding and skills that will help you advance in the workplace rather than unnecessary general education requirements. Participating in a bootcamp like Bloc saves you years of time and provides a great education.
