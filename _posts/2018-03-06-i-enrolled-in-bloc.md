title: On my way to Bloc.io
---

I have never been in to programming until I recently discovered coding bootcamp. As many other people I always wanted to be a cool hacker who can do some crazy stuff just from a laptop anywhere like in the movie,that was my idea of programming (it's kiddish,but don't tell me you never thought about it). So I've never considered myself in this field seriously just like "Yeah that would be awesome to know" but I don't have special talent for this or either time to go college for 4-6 years. After a lot of research and thinking of what should I do,where to get a degree without spending tons of money or time,that's where I opened the door to coding bootcamps which seemed like a great opportunity in my case. Choosing a bootcamp wasn't easy decision,thanks to reviews and research I picked Bloc.io.
